# Workplace Dynamics & Wellbeing.
This project utilizes a machine learning approach to understand how different work environments (i.e. onsite, hybrid, or remote) affect emotional and mental well-being of employees.

## Overview.
A majority of people spend their day working—and with COVID reshaping work environments across industries—understanding the impact on mental health is more important than ever. Our machine learning project primarily analyzes a 2021 Canadian survey, where individuals self-rated their mental health, to explore how remote, hybrid, and in-person work affects well-being. By identifying key trends, we aimed to help employers better understand and support their employees' needs. 


## Outline.
1. Dataset #1: "Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health" -> Dataset from Kaggle; Lacked feature correlation and visible pattern or clustering in EDA; Models performed near random chance
2. Dataset #2: "Work and Self Rated Mental Health Data" -> Data from 2021 Canadian Survey; Had some pattern / clustering in EDA; Imbalanced dataset
